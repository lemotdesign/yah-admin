# YAH Admin - Static Demo Deployment

This is a static demonstration version of the YAH Admin panel, configured for deployment on Netlify without server-side features.

## Current Status

✅ **Static Build Working** - The app builds successfully as a static site  
✅ **Login Page** - Displays properly with demo functionality  
✅ **Dashboard** - Shows demo data and interface  
✅ **Netlify Compatible** - No premium features or server functions required  

## What's Included

- Beautiful login interface with YAH Digital branding
- Demo dashboard with sample metrics and data
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Error boundaries and loading states
- Static export compatible with any CDN

## What's Removed for Static Deployment

- Auth0 authentication (will be re-added after successful static deployment)
- Prisma database integration (will be re-added after successful static deployment)
- API routes (will be re-added after successful static deployment)
- Server-side functionality

## Deployment

This version is specifically configured to deploy successfully on Netlify's free tier:

1. **No premium features** - Removed Next.js plugin and serverless functions
2. **Static export** - Builds to static HTML/CSS/JS files
3. **No secrets scanning issues** - Removed all Auth0 environment variables
4. **Simple configuration** - Minimal netlify.toml with just build settings

## After Successful Deployment

Once this static version deploys successfully, we can gradually re-add:

1. Auth0 authentication
2. Prisma database integration  
3. API routes for dynamic functionality
4. Server-side features

## Demo Features

- **Login Form**: Enter any email and click "Sign In" to see loading state and redirect to dashboard
- **Dashboard**: View sample metrics, activity feed, and admin interface
- **Navigation**: Use "Back to Login" button to navigate between pages

## Local Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Build

This creates static files in the `out/` directory ready for deployment.
