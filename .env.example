# Environment Variables Setup Guide

This file contains the required environment variables for the YAH Admin application.
Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add these variables:

## NextAuth Configuration
```
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-secret-key-here-32-characters-long
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://yah-admin.netlify.app
```

## GitHub OAuth Configuration
```
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your-github-oauth-app-client-id
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your-github-oauth-app-client-secret
```

## Notes:
- For production deployment on Netlify, add these as environment variables in the Netlify dashboard
- The NEXTAUTH_SECRET should be a random 32-character string
- Make sure NEXTAUTH_URL matches your deployed URL
- For local development, use http://localhost:3000 as NEXTAUTH_URL
- Create a GitHub OAuth App at https://github.com/settings/applications/new
- Set the Authorization callback URL to: https://yah-admin.netlify.app/api/auth/callback/github
