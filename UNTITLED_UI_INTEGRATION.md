# UI Framework Integration - Current vs Untitled UI

## Current Setup
The YAH Admin application currently uses:
- **shadcn/ui components** built on Radix UI primitives
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Custom component variants** with class-variance-authority

## Untitled UI Integration

If you have a PRO license for Untitled UI and want to integrate it, here's what you would need to do:

### 1. Install Untitled UI Dependencies
```bash
npm install @untitledui/react
# or for specific components
npm install @untitledui/react-button @untitledui/react-input @untitledui/react-table
```

### 2. Replace Current Components
You would need to replace the components in `/src/components/ui/` with Untitled UI equivalents:

```typescript
// Instead of current button.tsx
import { Button } from '@untitledui/react-button'

// Instead of current input.tsx  
import { Input } from '@untitledui/react-input'

// Instead of current avatar.tsx
import { Avatar } from '@untitledui/react-avatar'
```

### 3. Update Component Imports
Update all component imports throughout the application:

```typescript
// Change from:
import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button'

// To:
import { Button } from '@untitledui/react-button'
```

### 4. Configure Tailwind for Untitled UI
Update `tailwind.config.js` to include Untitled UI's design system:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  content: [
    './src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}',
    './node_modules/@untitledui/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}',
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {
      // Untitled UI design tokens would go here
    },
  },
  plugins: [
    require('@untitledui/tailwindcss'),
  ],
}
```

### 5. Benefits of Untitled UI
- **Professional Design System**: More polished and consistent components
- **Better Accessibility**: Enhanced ARIA support and keyboard navigation
- **Advanced Components**: More complex components like data tables, charts, etc.
- **Design Tokens**: Consistent spacing, typography, and color systems
- **Figma Integration**: Direct mapping between Figma designs and React components

## Current Status
The application is fully functional with the current setup. You can:
1. Deploy as-is with the current shadcn/ui setup
2. Gradually migrate to Untitled UI after deployment
3. Or pause development to implement Untitled UI first

## Migration Effort
- **Time**: 2-4 hours depending on customizations
- **Risk**: Low - mostly component import changes
- **Benefits**: Improved design consistency and additional components

Would you like me to proceed with Untitled UI integration or deploy the current version first?
